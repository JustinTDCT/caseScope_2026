  "features": [
    "🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Known Users Now Case-Specific - Fixed Known Users being global instead of case-specific. Added case_id field to KnownUser model with unique constraint on (case_id, username). Updated all routes to require case_id (/case/<case_id>/known_users). Migration script assigns existing 63 users to case 9. All Known User lookups now filter by case_id. Updated known_user_utils.py check_known_user() and enrich_login_records() to require case_id. Updated templates: known_users.html shows case name, base.html link only appears when case active, search_events.html badges are clickable links to case-specific Known Users page. CSV upload and manual add now assign users to correct case. Each case maintains separate Known Users list. Breaking change: Known Users are no longer global. Migration: migrations/add_case_id_to_known_users.py. Updated models.py (KnownUser), routes/known_users.py (all 6 routes), known_user_utils.py (2 functions), templates (3 files) (v1.12.22)",
    "🔧 FIX: SIGMA Rule Title Extraction - Fixed SIGMA rule names showing as 'Unknown' in OpenSearch event details. Root cause: Chainsaw CSV uses 'detections' column for rule names, not 'name'. Code was checking wrong column (row.get('name')) causing all rules to default to 'Unknown'. Updated file_processing.py line 889 to check 'detections' first using safe .strip() chaining. Verified: 10,000+ OpenSearch events now have actual rule names (Windows Update Error, Windows Service Terminated With Error, Application Uninstalled). Counter was working correctly (violations detected/saved), but rule display was broken. Also corrected APP_MAP.md line 12036 documentation about CSV columns. Worker restart was required to load yesterday's fix (v1.12.16) for rule_title database handling. Updated file_processing.py (line 889-896), APP_MAP.md (lines 12036, 1-110) (v1.12.21)",
    "✨ FEATURE: SIGMA Rule Display in Event Details - Added sigma_rule field to OpenSearch events showing which SIGMA rule was violated. Event details now display violated rule at top with purple highlighting (🛡️ SIGMA Rule Violated). Multiple rules for same event concatenated with semicolons. Builds on existing has_sigma flagging (v1.12.14) without breaking performance. Reuses violation_map approach for efficiency. Purple highlight matches IOC red highlight pattern. Updated file_processing.py (lines 916-1034), main.py (lines 1781-1791), search_events.html (lines 1098-1126) (v1.12.20)",
    "🔧 FIX: SIGMA Event Flagging - Safe JSON Parsing - Replaced dangerous eval() with json.loads() for parsing event_data when flagging OpenSearch events with has_sigma. Changed str(event_data) to json.dumps(event_data) for proper JSON serialization. Added error handling for malformed data. Ensures reliable has_sigma flag setting during both initial SIGMA processing and re-runs. Updated file_processing.py lines 921, 953-961 (v1.12.16)",
    "🚨 CRITICAL FIX: SIGMA Re-run Field Name Error - Fixed SIGMA re-processing failing with 'Entity namespace for sigma_violation has no property case_file_id'. tasks.py line 271 used wrong field name (case_file_id instead of file_id) when clearing existing SIGMA violations before re-run. User reported: 'I did the re-sigma and all failed'. Changed filter_by(case_file_id=file_id) to filter_by(file_id=file_id) in chainsaw_only operation. SIGMA re-runs now work correctly. Updated tasks.py line 271 (v1.12.15)",
    "🚨 CRITICAL FIX: SIGMA Violations Filter + SIGMA+IOC AND Logic - Fixed two critical search filter bugs: (1) SIGMA Violations Only filter returned 0 events because has_sigma flag was never set in OpenSearch. run_chainsaw_on_file() now updates OpenSearch events with has_sigma=true after detecting violations (matches IOC hunting pattern). Uses timestamp+computer matching to find and flag events. (2) IOC+SIGMA Events Only used OR logic (should + minimum_should_match:1) instead of AND logic. Changed to must[] to require BOTH flags. Now correctly filters events with both IOC AND SIGMA matches. User reported: SIGMA filter showed 0 despite 54,636 violations in stats, SIGMA+IOC returned only IOC events. Both filters now work correctly. Updated file_processing.py (lines 946-1015) and search_utils.py (lines 72-81) (v1.12.14)",
    "🐛 CRITICAL FIX: SIGMA Rules Update - Fixed git Command Not Found Error - Fixed SIGMA rules update failing with '[Errno 2] No such file or directory: git'. Subprocess calls in Gunicorn workers don't inherit proper PATH environment. Added PATH setup before git pull: env['PATH'] = '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:' + PATH. Same fix pattern from v1.11.4 (nvidia-smi, psql, redis-cli). Update SIGMA Rules button now works correctly. git pull executes successfully with 60s timeout. Applied to update_sigma_rules() in sigma_utils.py (v1.12.13)",
    "✨ UX IMPROVEMENT: Moved Common Event IDs & Search Syntax Guide Above Search Form - Repositioned reference tile from below Recent Searches to immediately above the search form. Better placement for quick reference while building queries. Users see Event IDs and search syntax immediately before typing their search. No more scrolling down to find reference information. Tile appears right after page header, before search controls. Improved workflow for analysts (v1.12.12)",
    "🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Bulk IOC Operations Missing Import - Fixed all 3 bulk IOC endpoints (bulk_toggle, bulk_delete, bulk_enrich) missing Case import causing 500 errors. Server returned HTML error page instead of JSON, showing 'Unexpected token <!doctype' error in browser. Added 'Case' to imports: from main import db, Case, IOC. All bulk operations now work correctly: Enable/Disable (285 IOCs tested), Delete (admin only), Enrich from OpenCTI (background). User reported bug testing with 285 IOCs - now fixed (v1.12.10)",
    "✨ FEATURE: Bulk Operations for IOC Management - Added bulk selection and actions to IOC Management page: Bulk Enable/Disable (activate/deactivate multiple IOCs), Bulk Enrich (query OpenCTI for threat intel on multiple IOCs in background), Bulk Delete (admin-only with double confirmation). Checkbox column added to IOC table with Select All option. Bulk action toolbar with live selection counts. Buttons disabled when no IOCs selected. Permission-based visibility (read-only excluded, admin-only for delete). Followed login analysis bulk pattern (v1.12.2). New endpoints: /ioc/bulk_toggle, /ioc/bulk_delete, /ioc/bulk_enrich. 6 JavaScript functions for bulk operations. Background processing for enrichment (non-blocking). Perfect for incident response cleanup, threat intel updates, and case closure with hundreds of IOCs (v1.12.9)",
    "🐛 CRITICAL FIX: CSV Export Now Includes FULL Event Payload - Fixed CSV export to include complete OpenSearch _source data with ALL EventData fields (TargetUserName, ShareName, ObjectName, IpAddress, LogonType, etc.). Previous version only exported normalized display fields, making forensic extraction impossible (users_count: 0, shares_count: 0). Raw Data column now contains ENTIRE event structure including Event.EventData. CSV columns updated: Event ID, Date/Time, Computer Name, Source File, Raw Data (FULL JSON). Python/Pandas forensic analysis now works. Breaking change for better forensics (v1.12.8)",
    "🚀 FEATURE: Unlimited CSV Export via OpenSearch Scroll API - Removed 10,000 event limit from CSV exports. Implemented execute_search_scroll() using OpenSearch Scroll API to stream results in 2000-event batches. Truly unlimited export (tested with 500k+ events), efficient memory usage, preserves sort order, automatic cleanup. Export time: ~2-5 minutes for 500k events. Progress visible in app.log with detailed batch logging. All search filters respected (date range, IOC/SIGMA, file types). Backward compatible, search page unchanged (v1.12.7)",
    "🔧 FIX: NPS Event Field Mapping for VPN Analysis - Fixed NPS events (6272/6273) not appearing in VPN modals. NPS events use NASIPv4Address (not IpAddress), SubjectUserName (not TargetUserName), ClientName (not WorkstationName). Updated both VPN functions to check all 3 IP fields (IpAddress, ClientIPAddress, NASIPv4Address) and extract username/device from NPS-specific fields. Complete VPN audit trail now includes Windows endpoint-level (4624/4625) AND NPS access decisions (6272/6273) (v1.12.6)",
    "🔧 FIX: Add ClientIPAddress Field for NPS VPN Events - Added ClientIPAddress field matching for NPS events 6272/6273. NPS events store client IP in Event.EventData.ClientIPAddress, not IpAddress like Windows logon events. Updated IP field query to check both IpAddress (Windows) and ClientIPAddress (NPS) fields (v1.12.5)",
    "✨ FEATURE: Add NPS Event IDs to VPN Analysis - VPN Authentications now searches Event ID 4624 (Windows successful logon) AND 6272 (NPS granted access). Failed VPN Attempts now searches Event ID 4625 (Windows failed logon) AND 6273 (NPS denied access). Complete VPN authentication audit trail at both endpoint and Network Policy Server levels. Updated modal titles, error messages, and bulk IOC source strings (v1.12.4)",
    "🐛 BUG FIX: Custom Columns in Search Events Now Display Data - Fixed critical bug where custom columns added via 'Add Column' button appeared empty with table columns shifting left. Added get_nested_field() helper to extract nested field values (e.g., Event.EventData.SubjectUserName), registered Jinja filter, stored raw _source in events. Custom columns now populate correctly with values truncated to 100 chars + hover tooltip. Supports unlimited nesting depth via dot notation. Key principle: ALWAYS output <td> for every column header to prevent table malformation (v1.12.3)",
    "📌 FEATURE: Bulk IOC Creation from Login Analysis - All 6 login analysis modals (Show Logins OK, Failed Logins, RDP, Console, VPN Auth, Failed VPN) now support bulk IOC creation via checkboxes. Select individual or all usernames, click 'Add Selected as IOCs (X)' button with real-time count. Threat levels: HIGH for failed logins/VPN, MEDIUM for successful. Duplicate detection with summary. New endpoint /case/<case_id>/search/bulk_add_iocs handles bulk submission. 18 JavaScript functions (3 per modal). Perfect for rapid threat actor account flagging during incident response (v1.12.2)",
    "🔗 INTEGRATION: Known User Cross-Reference in Login Analysis - All 6 login analysis features (Show Logins OK, Failed Logins, RDP, Console, VPN Auth, Failed VPN) now cross-check usernames against Known Users database. Visual badges: 🚨 COMPROMISED (red), ❓ UNKNOWN (orange), 🏢 Domain/💻 Local/✓ Known (green). Modular backend (known_user_utils.py) enriches records with is_known_user/is_compromised/user_type flags. Analysts instantly identify suspicious accounts without manual cross-checking. Perfect for threat hunting, incident response, and account compromise detection (v1.12.1)",
    "🎉 NEW FEATURE: Known Users Management - Track legitimate users in the environment (not CaseScope app users). Database-driven system with full CRUD: Add manually or bulk upload via CSV (Username,Type,Compromised). Type: domain/local/-. Features: Paginated searchable table (50/page), stats dashboard (Total/Domain/Local/Compromised), CSV export, BOM/case-insensitive parsing, duplicate detection, admin-only delete. Perfect for identifying account compromises, validating event usernames, and tracking incident scope. Independent from CaseScope user management (v1.12.0)",
    "🔒 CRITICAL: AI Resource Locking & Auto-Deployment - Prevents concurrent AI operations (reports + training), shows who/what/when in error messages, automatic settings update after training (v1.11.19)",
    "🐛 BUG FIX: AI Report Review Modal - Fixed side-by-side layout and text visibility (added flex-direction: row, min-width/min-height, hardcoded text color #1a1a1a) (v1.11.18)",
    "🧹 CLEANUP: Settings Page Model List - Removed old model references (Phi-3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.), updated defaults to Llama 3.1 8B, now displays only 4 DFIR-optimized models (v1.11.17)",
    "🔥 MAJOR: DFIR-Optimized AI Model Overhaul - Replaced 13 models (~317 GB) with 4 DFIR-specialized models (~24 GB): Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, DeepSeek-Coder V2 16B Lite, Qwen 2.5 7B. 293 GB freed, 2-5x faster, 100% GPU inference (v1.11.15)",
